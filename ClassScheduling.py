10:48 Fri: an easy way to handle the 0 position is just to have the time id and classes start
from 0. in reality you're converting the class numbers to numbers from 1 anyways. so why not.

BECAUSE when you keep an 0 in the front, sorting would be a big issue. including when you
are using zip. 


Parsing the Excels part hasn't been tested yet. The current code works for the demo data.


1. Preprocessing the data:

Parse a list of students and a list of their preferences.
For example:    Name            Preferred Classes
                Elizabeth       a, b, c, d
                Tessa           b, e, f, h
                Xinyi           c, g, m, n

Given a file like above, parse students = {Elizabeth, Tessa, Xinyi} and preferences = {[a, b, c, d], [b, e, f, h], [c, g, m, n]}.
Arrays we need from parsing: students, preferences, classes
    students -  array of all students
    preferences - array of preference lists of all students (parsed in same order as students)
    classes - array of all classes, each represented by an integer from 1 to m
    times - array of all time slots, each represented by an integer from 1 to w
