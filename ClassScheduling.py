1. Preprocessing the data:
Parse a list of students and a list of their preferences.

For example:    Name            Preferred Classes
                Elizabeth       a, b, c, d
                Tessa           b, e, f, h
                Xinyi           c, g, m, n
TESSA: Hey Lizzy! If you're just parsing the demo data, since we don't have preference lists of students, please create some table like the one above and write a function to parse it.

If given a table like this, parse students = {Elizabeth, Tessa, Xinyi} and preferences = {[a, b, c, d], [b, e, f, h], [c, g, m, n]}.

Arrays we need from parsing: students, preferences, classes
    students - list of all students
    preferences - list of lists of preferred classes for all students (parsed in same order as students)
    classes - list of all classes
    times - list of time slots
